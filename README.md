How to use:

- MPA_Heatwave_detection_ModelCode.m is the main script for the model (MATLAB based). It uses files in the Functions folder. Start here if you want to explore the model more. 

- MPA_Heatwave_detection_PlottingCode.R is the plotting code that generates the figures in the manuscripts (R based). Note that figures have been edited post-production (though no data was changed). This script uses files in the Outputs folder. Output files exist for all the scenarios in the manuscript and appendix.

- Parameter_Estimation.mlx is a MATLAB notebook file estimating specific model parameters from data. This script uses data in the PISCOData_20230125 folder. See the script for more information on these data.
